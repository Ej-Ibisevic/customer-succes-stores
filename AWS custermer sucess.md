Founded in 2015, Monzo Bank is the UK’s largest digital bank. Its seven-and-a-half million customers use Monzo’s mobile banking for money management, budgeting, and saving.

<p> Monzo's initial challange was securing sensative data processing applications, the need for reducing the vunerable surface area and enhancing security protocols.

<p> Monzo used AWS servises which let customers create isolated computer environments to protect highly sensitive data, they incorporated crytopgraphy and advance security protocals into credential request using AWS KMS (keys managment services), They also used AWS Nitro enclaves to improve visability into its authorasation system which would grant temporary permission as quickly as a few seconds.

<p> They did this by building a highly secure infrastructure on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud which provides secure and resizable compute capacity for virtually any workload.They also used Kubernetes on AWS—which makes it easy to run Kubernetes in the cloud with scalable and highly virtual machine infrastructure to deploy, scale, and orchestrate their containerized applications.

<p> Benefits  to the customer of Monzo's implementation include strong security guarantees and protection against malicious interference and the combination of AWS Nitro Enclaves and AWS KMS for enhanced security.
